Have you ever gone to [garrettlove.com](http://garrettlove.com)? Usually, you will find a half-completed website design. I interpret [garrettlove.com](http://garrettlove.com) as a challenge. Whenever I get some free time, I will work on finishing the design that is currently on the site.

My latest copycat design will be available on [garretthate.com](http://garretthate.com).

# Current design

Garrett's current website is a blank page. I improved the blank page by adding pentagons.
