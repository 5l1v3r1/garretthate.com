Have you ever gone to [garrettlove.com](http://garrettlove.com)? Usually, you will find a half-completed website design. I interpret [garrettlove.com](http://garrettlove.com) as a challenge. Whenever I get some free time, I will work on finishing the design that is currently on the site.

My latest copycat design will be available on [garretthate.com](http://garretthate.com).

# Current design

This is pretty much an exact replica of Garrett's current site except for two differences. First, I use the OpenSans font instead of the browser default. Second, I use JavaScript instead of `position: -webkit-sticky;` to achieve broader browser support.
